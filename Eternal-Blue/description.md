# Eternal Blue

Eternal blue is arguably one of the most famous exploits. With that being said, in order to defend against it, or even use it against other systems, you have to know how it works.

My task for you is for you to tell me what operating system(s) are vunerable to this exploit and what protocol it exploits. 

**you don't need to say what service packs and patches are required for this anomaly, just the operating system(s) and protocol**
